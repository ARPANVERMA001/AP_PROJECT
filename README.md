STICK HERO-JAVA FX PROJECT

DESCRIPTION:

The Stick Hero game is based on a retro arcade game theme. Here the game has a Stick-Hero with a stick and guess what this one increments infinitely! The player moves from one platform to another with the help of this rotating stick. It can invert and also get various bonusses like cherries and increment its score.

How To Play:

On the Home Screen Click on the Background to increment the length of the stick, click again to stop the incrementation, click again after the hero starts moving to collect the randomly generating cherries, However keep caution from colliding into the platform2.

You can save the game and exit the game. Reload it from the Home screen and much more.

Structure of The Project:

The Project is divided into various classes. Using various OOPS concepts like Abstarct Class, Polymorphism, Interfaces, JUnit, DesignPatterns, wrapper classes, Exception handling, Serialization-Deserialization, File writing. The main game is run by playing the run in the Main class.

The Main Homepage has two options, either to start the game or to load a preloaded game.

On the screen you can save the game state, see the score, lives, timer and cherries, and obviously play the game too. Do enter the

JUnit using Multithreading:

Have implemented Threading to continuously check the conditions of the animation in the game after every 10 seconds. Keeps printing "true" on the terminal.

Multithreaded Timer:

A timer has been maintained which maintains the time for which the player has played the game.

Design Pattern:

Decorator: To change the number of outfit of the Hero.

Singleton: To not create more than one label for Timer.

Media:

Background song has been implemented. Allmost all the images have been created by us using Pixel-Art.

NOTE:

We Have used absolute paths in the OutfitHero class, GamePlayController and in Main class. As relative paths were not supported by our interface. Kindly please change this to relative on your system or use appropriate absolute paths in your project.

Kindly use proper dependencies to run the project.
